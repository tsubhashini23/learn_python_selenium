# set() is a built-in function in Python
# It is used to create a set, which is an unordered, mutable, and unindexed collection of unique elements
# Duplicates are automatically removed
# Elements are unordered (no indexing or slicing)
# Mutable â€“ you can add or remove items
# Used for set operations like union, intersection, difference


# Remove duplicates from a list

numbers_list = [1,2,2,3,3,4,5,6,6]
new_numbers_list = set(numbers_list)
print(new_numbers_list)

# Set operations

a = set([1,2,3])
b = set([3,4,5])

print(a.union(b))
print(a.intersection(b))
print(a.difference(b))

#Check whether a value is in the list or not

my_set = set([10,20,30,30])
print(30 in my_set)
print(40 in my_set)

#Convert string to unique characters
s = "subha"
my_char_set = set(s)
new_set = dict.fromkeys(s)
print(my_char_set)
print("New set as is:",new_set)
print("Only the keys",new_set.keys())
print("".join(new_set.keys()))
print("New set as list",list(new_set))
